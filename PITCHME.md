#### <span style="font-family:Arial;">replication from MySQL to Vertica</span>

---

##### If this is not about you, repligator will not help you

- You have several MySQL servers (perhaps from microservices) with tables of more than 100 million rows
- You are not using Kafka or other data pipelines
- You want to execute analytical requests or collect statistics
- Maybe you have a slave server where you launch these requests and wait hours for results
- You do not have an ETL process

## Heterogeneous replication from a relational DBMS in a data warehouse

With repligator, you can replicate all your data from MySQL to [Vertica](https://my.vertica.com/docs/8.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/ConceptsGuide/Other/ConceptsGuide.htm%3FTocPath%3DVertica%2520Concepts%7C_____0)
, and you do not need any ETL processes. 

Repligator supports both data replication and data schema modification events.

## Operation

You can view cache status through a web interface http://yourrepligator.host:8080/info

When Repligator encounters a DDL event that it cannot execute, it stops the replication process and waits for the operatorâ€™s decision. To continue replication, you can use the web interface http://yourrepligator.host:8080/skip or send the `Skip` command to Slack chat bot.
